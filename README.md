# Heart-Rate-Mortality-Variations-Race-and-Gender
Analyzing Heart Rate Mortality Data for different counties in the US for the year 2014

The purpose of this project is to analyze heart rate mortality data for different counties across the US for the year 2014 according to race and ethnicity. 
Mortality is defined as the number of deaths per 100,000 population. We will explore variations according to:

1. Gender (Male or Female)

2. Ethnicity (White, Hispanic, Black, Asian)

Conclusion:

Based on our analysis, the American Indian and Alaskan Native population is at the highest risk of dying from heart diseases, the Hispanic population is at the lowest risk of dying from heart diseases.

We also noted that men are higher at a risk of dying from Heart disease than women. There are also significant differences between similar genders across different ethnicities and needs to be explored further.
